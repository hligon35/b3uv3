## Getting Started
```
cd v3
npm install   # already done once
npm run dev
```
Visit http://localhost:3000

## Environment Variables
Create `.env.local`:
```
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMS_API=/api/forms
FORMS_BACKUP_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/your-script-id/exec
FORMS_SIGNING_SECRET=<same SECRET value configured in Apps Script>
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG...
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=info@b3unstoppable.net
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=B3U
SENDGRID_REPLY_TO=info@b3unstoppable.net
SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL=info@b3unstoppable.net
```

## Vercel Deployment
- Deploy this repo to Vercel as a standard Next.js project.
- The site now uses the Next API route at `src/pages/api/forms/[[...path]].ts` for SendGrid-first form handling.
- Google Apps Script remains the persistence layer and fallback mailer. Story submissions still rely on it for moderation links and the approved-story feed.
- Vercel Analytics is enabled in `src/pages/_app.tsx` through `@vercel/analytics/react`.
- Cloudflare Web Analytics can run alongside Vercel Analytics by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`.
- Required Vercel env vars: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMS_API`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`, `FORMS_BACKUP_URL`, `FORMS_SIGNING_SECRET`, `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`, `SENDGRID_FROM_NAME`, `SENDGRID_REPLY_TO`, `SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL`.
- Optional Vercel env var: `SENDGRID_MARKETING_LIST_IDS` as a comma-separated list of SendGrid Marketing list IDs. Newsletter signups are upserted into SendGrid Marketing Contacts and attached to those lists when provided.

## Forms Delivery
- Primary mail delivery runs through SendGrid via the Vercel API route.
- Apps Script remains the backup mailer and persistence layer.
- Newsletter signups are also upserted into SendGrid Marketing Contacts.
- If SendGrid fails, the API route falls back to Apps Script mail delivery.

## Code Organization
```
src/
  components/  # UI building blocks
  pages/       # Route pages
  data/        # Static placeholder data
  styles/      # Global Tailwind layer
```

## Adding GSAP Scroll Animations (Outline)
1. Create `useReveal.ts` hook watching elements with `.fade-in-up`.
2. Or use GSAP + ScrollTrigger: register plugin, animate sections with data attributes.
3. Lazy-load GSAP to keep initial bundle lean.

## Commerce Strategy (Option)
- MVP: Snipcart embed (fast, no backend).
- Advanced: Stripe Checkout session creation via Next.js API route `/api/checkout`.

## Testing Roadmap
- Add Jest + React Testing Library.
- Snapshot hero, interaction tests for cart, form validation tests.

## License
Internal / proprietary (adjust as needed).

Reach next milestone: implement scroll spy & GSAP reveals, then wire real podcast feed.
