          <p class="about-roles">
            Combat Veteran | Coach | Speaker | Author
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout a series of life changing events, Bridget “Bree” Charles
            is a decorated combat veteran, coach, upcoming author, dynamic
            transformational speaker and entrepreneur; dedicated to empowering
            individuals to overcome adversity and unlock their full potential.
            After surviving deep personal trauma—including childhood abuse,
            sexual violence, domestic violence and military PTSD—Bree found
            healing through faith, mental resilience and radical self discovery;
            her past pain connects her closer to her purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, she empowers individuals who feel stuck, overloaded, or
            disqualified by fear and trauma to reclaim their voice, walk boldly
            in purpose, and build the life or business they once believed was
            out of reach. Her mission is to use her leadership skills and own
            journey as a means to help others spark their inner strength and
            realize their true potential.
          </p>

          <p>
            She has seamlessly transitioned from the battlefield of the streets
            of West Philadelphia, the United States Army to the forefront of
            personal development. For those ready to embark on a transformative
            journey towards personal excellence, Bree offers the expertise,
            experience and empathy to guide the way, through her masterclasses,
            coaching and speaking abilities.
