      "description": "Send us a text Addiction often begins quietly—with pain, prescriptions, sleepless nights, and the pressure to appear strong—and my own path through chronic pain, Ambien dependence, and a military mindset of hiding struggle shows how tolerance and numbness can spiral into broken relationships and denial. Hitting bottom didn’t destroy me; it woke me up to surrender control to God, embrace a greater purpose, and admit I couldn’t fight addiction alone. Recovery came through practical steps: daily affirmations, a clean environment free of drama, accountability programs, mentors who’ve walked the path, and strategies to protect sleep, manage pain, and reset the mind without substances. This message is for anyone tempted by “just tonight” or families suffering in silence—choose action now, fight fear with repetition, and surround yourself with people who expect you to win. The fight continues daily, but progress, not perfection, is the goal, and sharing your story forward begins today. https://www.facebook.com/bree.b3u https://www.instagram.com/burnbreakbecomeunstoppable",

      "description": "Send us a text The most surprising part isn’t the pain—it’s the moment the craving disappeared. Rochelle sits with us and tells a story many hide: childhood molestation, a decades-long addiction that felt like relief until it wasn’t, and the day she chose a police car over another hit. What follows is not a miracle montage but a set of small, relentless choices—thirty days of prayer in county, six months of structure, and a first year built around meetings, mentors, and learning to trust quiet again. We trace the ripple effects of early harm into adult life: hypervigilance with kids, guilt over sending her children to safer homes, and the complicated love that still shows up for family who couldn’t show up for her. Rochelle is candid about triggers, boundaries, and the humility of “one day at a time.” She talks about getting baptized high and still being met by grace, about discovering she was emotionally stuck at twelve and deciding to bring that younger girl forward instead of leaving her behind. There’s laughter here too—a frank honesty about dentures, math classes that won’t quit, and the way a partner’s steady love can rewrite the meaning of touch. We move from survival to service. Rochelle returns to school for human services, earns a substance abuse certificate, and lays out plans for a recovery home focused on people leaving prison—IDs, stability, dignity, and a path back to community. We talk about protecting children, refusing to be bystanders, and practicing the B3U ethos: burn the lies, break the cycles, become unstoppable. If you’ve ever felt numb just to make it through, this conversation offers a map back to yourself—realistic, faith-filled, and fiercely hopeful.

      "description": "Send us a text Ever notice how one heated moment can rewrite the story—casting you as the problem while the real issue slips into the background? We go straight at that trap and unpack the quiet ways we hand over our power: explosive reactions that cost credibility, silence that breeds resentment, and people-pleasing that looks kind but leaves us empty. Through raw, funny, and candid stories—from a Chuck E. Cheese confrontation to navigating racial disrespect with composure—we explore how to stay grounded when others expect a performance. Ashley opens up about military life as a Black woman and the pressure to fit the “pit bull” stereotype, sharing how calm leadership can be more effective than volume. We walk through what it means to be strategic under stress: when to speak, when to document, when to step back. The conversation moves into trauma, therapy, and the long work of rebuilding self-worth. Fear still knocks, but it doesn’t get a vote. If you’ve ever felt stuck in loops of overthinking, muted needs, or relationships that drain, this is a roadmap out. We get practical with boundaries that actually protect peace—saying a full-stop no, skipping environments that sabotage growth, and setting standards in dating and friendship that add rather than subtract. We talk parenting as a mirror for power, leaving toxic patterns when our kids start to dim, and choosing purpose over approval through daily habits that build momentum. Faith undergirds it all—naming God as the source of courage and the anchor that steadies every step. Hit play to learn how to hold your center, keep your voice, and move forward with intention.

      "description": "Send us a text The journey from being misunderstood to discovering your true potential often requires someone who can see the diamond beneath the rough exterior. In this profound conversation with Prophetess Moina Tucker, founder of The Altar Experience, we uncover how early labels nearly limited her future before a dedicated teacher recognized her gifts. Prophetess Tucker shares her remarkable transition from being placed in remedial classes to discovering her spiritual calling. With raw honesty, she reveals how mentorship transformed her life and shaped her ministry philosophy: \"Seeing people, not looking at them.\" This powerful distinction guides her approach to connecting with those who might feel judged or excluded in traditional religious settings. Through vivid metaphors, Tucker explains how diamonds form deep within the earth until they become so magnificent the pressure pushes them to the surface, where they finally shine when exposed to air. Similarly, many of us wait beneath the surface for someone to recognize our potential or for circumstances to push us toward our destiny. The conversation takes a practical turn as Tucker addresses the challenges of balancing multiple roles—pastor, military veteran, publisher, wife, mother, and grandmother. Her candid admission that \"sometimes I didn&apos;t have it together\" offers refreshing permission for listeners to acknowledge their own struggles. Her wisdom shines in statements like \"You can&apos;t pour from an empty cup\" and \"Have your moment, but don&apos;t let your moment have you\"—acknowledging emotions while refusing to be defined by them. For anyone questioning their purpose or facing setbacks, Tucker provides actionable guidance: align your work with your passion, study your craft, learn from others, and most importantly, protect your energy by setting boundaries. \"Stop giving people the best of you that don&apos;t deserve you,\" she advises, drawing from biblical wisdom about discernment. Whether you&apos;re seeking spiritual renewal, struggling to overcome labels, or simply needing encouragement to reclaim your power, this conversation offers both comfort and challenge.

      "description": "Send us a text What happens when a crisis counselor confronts her own trauma? Chenia Hughes brings raw honesty and professional insight to this powerful conversation about healing, helping others, and finding your true worth. As a licensed master social worker responding to mental health emergencies in homes, schools, jails, and on the streets, Chenia shares how crisis work \"chose her\" after discovering her natural ability to connect with people in distress. With a calm spirit and personal understanding of pain, she navigates the challenging world of crisis intervention, primarily dealing with suicidal ideation, substance abuse issues, and youth struggling with identity and bullying. The conversation takes a deeply personal turn when Chenia reveals how her relationship with her biological father shaped her sense of self-worth and accomplishments. Despite being a first-generation college graduate, her father&apos;s absence at graduation and apparent disinterest in her achievements left emotional wounds that drove her to constantly seek validation. Through therapy, she learned to recognize these patterns and address them, finding fulfillment in knowing her true identity rather than external approval. One of the most eye-opening segments addresses misconceptions about crisis management. Contrary to popular belief, it&apos;s actually quite difficult to hospitalize someone for mental health reasons. \"It&apos;s not against the law to be delusional,\" Chenia points out, highlighting frustrations in a system that often fails to provide adequate intervention until situations escalate to criminal behavior. This episode beautifully illustrates how confronting our past wounds can free us to live more authentically and help others more effectively. Whether you&apos;re in a helping profession, navigating your own healing journey, or supporting someone in crisis, Chenia&apos;s wisdom offers practical insights and spiritual encouragement for breaking cycles and becoming unstoppable. https://www.facebook.com/bree.b3u https://www.instagram.com/burnbreakbecomeunstoppable",

During this powerful conversation, Dr. Hegwood opens up about her transformative experience at the Altar Experience event, where she arrived feeling \"tired, exhausted, picked out, picked on, and lied on.\" What follows is a remarkable story of breaking free from limitation and reclaiming divine authority. When Dr. Capehart preached about removing the \"grave clothes\" that bind us—those spoken words of death that keep us from our purpose—Dr. Hegwood recognized herself as \"that one person\" who needed the breakthrough. As a Family Nurse Practitioner with a doctoral degree, Dr. Hegwood navigates the complex challenges of being a woman of color in healthcare, facing opposition not just from outside her community but sometimes from within it. Her work spans mental health, detox, rehabilitation, and primary care, requiring her to address every aspect of her patients&apos; wellbeing. Through it all, she&apos;s discovered that true power comes not from titles or others&apos; approval, but from standing firm in her divine purpose. \"I take my power back, I take my authority back. I am who God says I am,\" she declares with conviction that&apos;s impossible to ignore. For anyone feeling diminished or constrained by others&apos; expectations, Dr. Hegwood offers this wisdom: \"Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord. When people want you to sit down, when people want you to take down, stand still and firm on the Word of God.\" Join us for this month-long series featuring inspiring stories from the Altar Experience. And remember—burn through the past, break the cycle, and become unstoppable in your purpose. https://www.facebook.com/bree.b3u https://www.instagram.com/burnbreakbecomeunstoppable",

      "description": "Send us a text Postpartum depression doesn&apos;t discriminate—not even against women of faith. In this raw and powerful conversation, Pastor Kristie Anderson bravely shares her journey through the darkness of postpartum depression while balancing her roles as a mother of three, pastor, and healthcare professional. Kristie&apos;s story begins with her first pregnancy during March 2020—right as COVID lockdowns began. What followed was a perfect storm: her husband contracting COVID shortly after their daughter&apos;s birth, leaving her alone with a colicky newborn; becoming pregnant again just 11 months later; losing her father to a heart attack; and eventually facing a life-threatening hemorrhage during her third child&apos;s delivery that left doctors wondering how she survived. The most chilling moment comes when Kristie reveals hearing a voice telling her to harm her baby—a turning point where she recognized her postpartum depression as more than just exhaustion. \"That&apos;s a demon,\" she says, detailing how her faith became her anchor when she couldn&apos;t trust her own thoughts. Rather than portraying her struggles as separate from her ministry, Kristie explains how these trials actually strengthened her ability to pastor others: \"I wouldn&apos;t want to be in their past if I didn&apos;t have to do nothing...how could you teach me? It&apos;s better from experience.\" Whether you&apos;re struggling with postpartum depression, supporting someone who is, or simply interested in understanding this common but often misunderstood condition, this episode offers wisdom from someone who&apos;s walked through the fire. Kristie shares practical strategies that helped her heal: prayer, therapy, medical support, honest communication with doctors, and building a village of support—even when biological family isn&apos;t available. Listen now to discover why rest isn&apos;t just a luxury but a biblical command, how to recognize when you need help, and why breaking the silence around mental health is essential for healing. https://www.facebook.com/bree.b3u https://www.instagram.com/burnbreakbecomeunstoppable",

In this powerful episode of Be Free You, host Brie Charles takes us inside The Altar Experience, where her encounter with 78-year-old apostle Dr. Yadar Nichols becomes a masterclass in spiritual transformation. Dr. Nichols—who began preaching at just 13 years old and carries over 60 years of ministry experience—delivers a timely word about stepping into new seasons with boldness. \"The old wine is predictable,\" she explains, \"but the new wine is shocking.\" This prophetic insight resonates deeply with Brie&apos;s own message of transformation, creating one of those rare moments when spiritual dots connect before your very eyes. The conversation takes vulnerable turns as Brie opens up about church hurt, PTSD, and questioning her purpose despite founding three impactful community initiatives. Dr. Nichols responds with hard-earned wisdom: \"Though you may be suffering now, know that you&apos;re coming out to the other side.\" Her powerful teaching about the necessity of life&apos;s fires offers profound perspective—when you&apos;re chosen by God, the journey through fire isn&apos;t optional, but it produces something uniquely powerful that sets you apart. Whether you&apos;re questioning your purpose, healing from past wounds, or seeking to understand why your path has been so challenging, this episode offers hope that nothing in your journey has been wasted.

      "description": "Send us a text What happens when you step beyond your comfort zone and embrace the calling you never thought was meant for you? Pastor Tina Lee knows this journey intimately. Once a self-described \"background person\" who shied away from the spotlight, she now leads New Harvest Christian Center in Battle Creek, Michigan with purpose and conviction. The Altar Experience, hosted by Pastor Moena Tucker and Jamie Tucker, created a sacred space where women found breakthrough and healing through shared stories. As Pastor Tina reveals in this powerful conversation with host Brie Charles, purpose often doesn&apos;t arrive fully formed—it emerges through baby steps and the courageous decision to believe you&apos;re chosen despite your broken pieces. \"Sometimes we feel alone...but my purpose was not yet revealed,\" Pastor Tina shares, offering hope to listeners feeling lost or directionless. Her most profound insight challenges our understanding of being chosen: contrary to feeling special or privileged, those with the most powerful purposes often emerge from places of deep brokenness. \"You are the one that&apos;s chosen because you have a testimony to help someone else,\" she explains, reframing past trauma as preparation for helping others. The conversation culminates with Pastor Tina&apos;s mission for the coming year—\"taking back your power\"—which perfectly complements Brie&apos;s vision to help listeners \"burn through the path, break the cycle and become unstoppable.\" Tune in for an authentic dialogue that will inspire you to see purpose in your pain and recognize that your story, especially the difficult chapters, might be exactly what someone else needs to hear. https://www.facebook.com/bree.b3u https://www.instagram.com/burnbreakbecomeunstoppable",

The answer might be simpler than you think—you&apos;ve been giving your power away. In this raw, heartfelt episode, I dive deep into the often unconscious ways we surrender our power to people, places, and even our own pain. Drawing from my personal journey through military service, abusive relationships, and healing from trauma, I share how I finally learned to reclaim my energy at age 53 after decades of people-pleasing and shrinking myself to fit others&apos; expectations. We explore the uncomfortable truth that \"every time you silence your truth to keep the peace, you declare war on yourself.\" This powerful realization transformed how I approach relationships, work, and self-care. I share the exact strategies that helped me move from constantly seeking external validation to becoming the gatekeeper of my own energy—including morning mantras, boundary-setting practices, and daily check-ins that revolutionized my relationship with myself. Whether you&apos;re struggling with workplace burnout, toxic family dynamics, or simply feeling like you&apos;ve lost yourself in the process of caring for everyone else, this episode offers practical wisdom for taking back what&apos;s rightfully yours.

Lance Williams faced this question head-on after being arrested for selling controlled substances in his early twenties. In this raw and powerful conversation with his big sister and host of B3u Bree Charles, Lance takes us through the life-altering moment when he found himself processing through the county jail system – describing it as a surreal experience that forced him to confront difficult questions about his path forward. The mental toll of having a criminal record became what Lance now identifies as his greatest challenge. \"When you get records, you start reading up on stuff and you can&apos;t get a job, you can&apos;t get an apartment...is my life over?\" This barrier wasn&apos;t physical but psychological – what he calls \"the biggest disability\" – a mindset that limits possibilities without even trying. Yet rather than surrendering to these limitations, Lance chose transformation. His journey reveals the unexpected paths to success that opened when traditional doors seemed closed. From starting a cleaning business with just a few hundred dollars to building his own successful trucking company, Lance demonstrates how entrepreneurship became his pathway to financial independence and personal redemption. \"Having a record is not a death sentence,\" he insists, though it required greater determination and creativity to overcome. This conversation goes beyond personal triumph to explore deeper questions about environment versus choice, generational progress, and the power of determination. Lance challenges listeners to question limiting beliefs and societal expectations while offering practical wisdom for anyone facing seemingly insurmountable obstacles. \"Everything they said I couldn&apos;t do, I&apos;ve done,\" he shares, proving that with the right mindset, past mistakes don&apos;t have to dictate your future.

      "description": "Send us a text When Monique Smith became a warrant officer in the military, she never expected the battlefield would be within her own unit. As a Black woman and subject matter expert in information systems, she discovered that her greatest challenge wasn&apos;t the technical complexities of her job, but the racism and sexism that threatened to undermine her expertise and achievements. \"They don&apos;t like to see that a woman knows more than they do, but tap on, the Black woman knows more than the white officer,\" Monique explains, detailing how male colleagues would deliberately sabotage her systems to make her look incompetent. The constant battle to prove herself pulled her away from her naturally laid-back personality, creating health problems and mental strain that seemed insurmountable. What makes this conversation with Bree Charles especially powerful is Monique&apos;s candid description of her healing journey. After realizing \"this is not you,\" she turned inward, developing spiritual practices that restored her sense of self. Her advice for anyone facing discrimination resonates deeply: \"Remember who you are. When you walk in you, they cannot mess with you.\" Throughout her 21-year military career, Monique&apos;s leadership philosophy evolved into one of nurturing potential rather than punishing mistakes. She shares touching stories of soldiers she mentored – from the suicidal young man who later thrived as a sergeant to the anxious soldier with high blood pressure who&apos;s now an E7 in Special Forces. These examples illustrate her profound understanding that \"there&apos;s no me without us\" and that true leadership requires seeing beyond immediate behaviors to recognize underlying struggles. Now retired and planning to open an assisted living facility, Monique embodies the spirit of resilience and self-acceptance. Her grounding techniques and meditation practices offer practical tools for anyone navigating hostile environments while trying to maintain inner peace. This conversation isn&apos;t just about surviving workplace discrimination – it&apos;s a master class in reclaiming your authentic self and turning trauma into wisdom that benefits others. https://www.facebook.com/bree.b3u https://www.instagram.com/burnbreakbecomeunstoppable",

Vernard reveals how humor initially masked his trauma before becoming his healing pathway. \"All my life I&apos;ve been funny,\" he shares, explaining how he was the \"barbecue comedian\" who made everyone laugh at cookouts. Yet beneath the laughter lay unprocessed war trauma and childhood wounds that eventually brought him to a breaking point. With disarming honesty, Vernard recounts the day he contemplated taking his life—and how an attentive church bishop recognized his pain and mobilized support that saved him. What makes this conversation truly transformative is Vernard&apos;s practical wisdom about daily life with PTSD. He introduces powerful concepts like \"closing your tabs\"—a metaphor comparing an overwhelmed mind to a computer with too many browser windows open—and explains how reframing his marriage from having a \"caregiver\" to a \"partner in recovery\" revolutionized his healing journey. His wife, who knew nothing about the military or PTSD when they met at a comedy club, became his strongest ally by learning about his triggers while he committed to therapy and medication. Vernard&apos;s evolution into The Laugh Therapist happened organically when a friend asked what got him through trauma. Now serving as a veteran spokesperson for suicide awareness, he combines speaking with humor to make difficult conversations about mental health accessible. \"God gives us two things: chance and choice,\" Vernard reflects. \"He gives us a chance when we open our eyes in the morning.

      "description": "Send us a text Perseverance isn&apos;t just about hanging on; it&apos;s about showing up day after day when there&apos;s no guarantee your dream will materialize. On this powerful episode, former NFL player and Super Bowl champion Bryan Hall reveals how he kept pushing forward as a janitor at his former high school during the 2011 NFL lockout – working without pay for months while training alone, all while family and friends questioned his path. \"Right when you&apos;re ready to quit is right when your breakthrough&apos;s there,\" shares Hall, whose determination was rewarded when the Baltimore Ravens called just days after his lowest moment. His story illuminates how opportunity favors the prepared, even when preparation means scraping walls by day and working out alone by evening. Beyond the glory of his Super Bowl victory, Hall candidly discusses his challenging transition from defensive tackle to linebacker (losing 70 pounds in just months), career setbacks, and his evolution into a financial representative helping families build generational wealth. Now with Northwestern Mutual, he&apos;s passionate about expanding financial literacy and creating pathways to economic empowerment. What separates this conversation from typical sports success stories is Hall&apos;s nuanced perspective on mentorship, growth and criticism. Rather than focusing exclusively on youth development, he challenges us to consider how adults model growth: \"The youth is actually looking back at you... I know a lot of 40-year-old men that act like they&apos;re 19 because at 19, they stopped growing.\" This wisdom reflects his philosophy of empowering others through awareness rather than prescriptions – showing people their options instead of dictating their paths. Ready to reshape how you view perseverance, pressure and purpose? Listen now and discover why Hall considers pressure \"a privilege\" and how transparency about where you truly are creates the foundation for authentic growth. Your breakthrough might be closer than you think. https://www.facebook.com/bree.b3u https://www.instagram.com/burnbreakbecomeunstoppable",

      "description": "Send us a text Today’s episode is a raw and unfiltered conversation with Colvin Carter—a man who has lived through silent battles that many never see. Colvin’s story is one shaped by the pain of two failed marriages, the heartbreak of not having the chance to raise his only son, and a lifelong struggle with weight and self-worth that has touched every part of his journey. But in the middle of the weight—both physical and emotional—Colvin found something deeper: the strength to face his truth, the courage to heal, and the voice to help others do the same. This episode isn’t about perfection. It’s about process. About showing up broken, speaking from the scar—not the wound—and learning to carry pain without letting it define you. If you’ve ever felt like your past disqualified you, or that shame had the final word—Colvin’s story is proof that it doesn’t. https://www.facebook.com/bree.b3u https://www.instagram.com/burnbreakbecomeunstoppable",

      "description": "Send us a text Have you ever felt like giving up when the daily grind seemed too overwhelming? When raising children, advancing your career, building a business, or navigating relationships pushed you to your breaking point? That&apos;s exactly where transformation happens. In this deeply personal episode, I share my journey as a single mother of five who joined the military at age 30, survived a toxic marriage, built multiple businesses, and completed my college education at 53 after recovering from a stroke. These weren&apos;t just challenges—they were the soil in which the fruits of my labor grew. Many of us struggle silently, wondering if our efforts will ever pay off. I&apos;ve been there—waking before dawn for military PT while my children slept, facing younger superiors who didn&apos;t understand my life experience, launching businesses without adequate funding, and returning to school decades after dropping out. Through each struggle, I discovered that greatness emerges directly from pain. The most valuable lesson I&apos;ve learned is that nothing worthwhile comes easily. When we build our lives brick by brick through experience and perseverance, we create something far stronger than what could ever be handed to us. But there&apos;s a crucial balance—like a car that won&apos;t run without gas regardless of its mechanical condition, we must remember to refuel our spirits when life demands too much. Your current struggles are the seeds you&apos;re planting for future harvests. Water them with faith, nurture them with persistence, but don&apos;t forget to care for yourself in the process. The fruits of your labor will come, and they&apos;ll be sweeter for the journey you took to grow them. https://www.facebook.com/bree.b3u https://www.instagram.com/burnbreakbecomeunstoppable",

Ashley&apos;s story begins with unimaginable loss – her mother murdered by her father when she was just two years old – yet transforms into a powerful testament to the human capacity for resilience and purpose. Through raw, honest conversation, Ashley reveals how early tragedy created a pattern that would follow her throughout life, culminating in an abusive relationship that mirrored her childhood trauma. The turning point? A profound moment when her young son&apos;s simple words – \"You did the right thing, Ma\" – awakened her to breaking generational cycles of pain. Ashley&apos;s 21-year military journey began as an escape but became a crucible for her strength, earning her the nickname \"Pit Bull\" for her unwavering determination. Now a successful PR specialist and business owner, she describes the people who&apos;ve supported her healing as \"healing compasses\" – guiding her back to positivity when darkness threatens to overwhelm. Perhaps most powerful is Ashley&apos;s message about facing trauma head-on: \"You must face your trauma so you can see in front of you instead of always trying to cover up what was behind you.\" Her journey demonstrates how vulnerability becomes strength when we stop hiding our wounds and start using them to connect authentically with others. Whether you&apos;re navigating your own trauma or supporting someone who is, Ashley&apos;s story offers a roadmap for turning pain into purpose. How might your own challenges become the foundation for something meaningful?
